Amongst women, this is even lower, maybe because of busy schedules, family obligations or lower education levels. Of course this cannot be generalised. Urban working women are more aware of the need for preventive health check ups. They are tech savvy . They have more easy access to health care facilities and may have financial independence to focus on their needs. And yet, we still see women, even educated urban women underestimating the health risk of a breast lump or abnormal menstrual bleeding. Preventive health checks may vary depending on the age or particular medical history of the woman but in general, these are the areas of focus. 1.Breast cancer is the commonest cancer in Indian women. Breast is an organ that can be easily examined either manually or by ultrasound or Mammography. It is curable when treated properly and in time. 2.Cervical cancer incidence rates vary but North East India still has very high rates of both incidence as well as deaths. It is estimated that 123,907 cases of invasive cervical cancer will occur every year in India with 77,348 deaths .This is a huge burden . Yet, this cancer can be prevented with a HPV vaccine and cured when diagnosed in the early stages. Regular screening with Pap smear or HPV testing is recommended for all sexually active women at 25-30 years of age. 3.Screening for chronic diseases like Diabetes and Hypertension should start at 50 or earlier if there are risk factors 4.Screening for anaemia is specially important for Indian women.</p> <p>Awareness activities are very important to encourage such screenings and to prevent delay in seeking adequate and timely health care .</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="preventive"/><category term="health"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Raise health awareness]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Recurrent UTI in women</title><link href="https://drayona.github.io/blog/2024/rec-uti/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Recurrent UTI in women"/><published>2024-11-17T00:32:13+00:00</published><updated>2024-11-17T00:32:13+00:00</updated><id>https://drayona.github.io/blog/2024/rec-uti</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://drayona.github.io/blog/2024/rec-uti/"><![CDATA[<p>Did you know that adult women are the group with highest risk of UTI or urinary tract infection, specially Acute Cystitis ( Bladder infection).1 in 5 adult women will experience UTI at least once in their lifetime. This is mainly because of the shorter length of the female urethra and also because of the changes in her body at different times of her life. Hence, pregnancy and menopause are both periods of high risk for UTI in a womanâ€™s life. Increased rates of UTI are also seen with sex ( so called honeymoon cystitis), because of proximity of the urethral opening to the vagina. Common symptoms of acute cystitis are dysuria, frequency, urgency,feeling of bladder fullness, suprapubic pain and tenderness.</p> <p>We will talk about prevention / decreasing the risk of recurrent cystitis in a later post</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="urinary"/><category term="burning"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[why do some women have recurrent uti]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Menstural Hygeine Video</title><link href="https://drayona.github.io/blog/2024/menstrual-hygiene/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Menstural Hygeine Video"/><published>2024-06-02T00:32:13+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-02T00:32:13+00:00</updated><id>https://drayona.github.io/blog/2024/menstrual-hygiene</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://drayona.github.io/blog/2024/menstrual-hygiene/"><![CDATA[<p>In this video, Ayona talks about menstrual hygeine.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3mjI0sT6JQk?si=NW-5nci9b74nvNK_" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" width="auto" height="auto"/> </figure> </div> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="hygiene"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ayona talks about menstrual hygeine.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Laproscopic surgery</title><link href="https://drayona.github.io/blog/2024/laproscopy-video/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Laproscopic surgery"/><published>2024-06-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://drayona.github.io/blog/2024/laproscopy-video</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://drayona.github.io/blog/2024/laproscopy-video/"><![CDATA[<p>This is an example post including a local video file.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <video src="/assets/video/laproscopy.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" autoplay="" controls=""/> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> A simple, elegant caption looks good between video rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all. </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="surgery"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ayona performs aproscopic surgery.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">- YouTube</title><link href="https://drayona.github.io/blog/2023/youtube/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="- YouTube"/><published>2023-02-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-02-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://drayona.github.io/blog/2023/--youtube</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://drayona.github.io/blog/2023/youtube/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Enjoy the videos and music you love, upload original content, and share it all with friends, family, and the world on YouTube.]]></summary></entry></feed>
