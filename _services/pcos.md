Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome is one of the commonest hormonal diseases diagnosed in women of
reproductive period. There is a wide range in the prevalence of this disease throughout the world
ranging from 7% to 28%.There are few pan India studies but studies done in South India and
Maharashtra report the prevalence of PCOS as 9.13% and 22.5% (10.7% by Androgen Excess
Society criteria) respectively.
PCOS causes

* Irregular or delayed menstrual cycles or no menses at all for months
* Infertility
* Excessive or rapid weight gain and metabolic syndrome
* Excess hair growth on the face, chest, abdomen, or upper thighs ( hirsutism)
* Severe acne or acne which occurs after adolescence and does not respond to usual
treatments
* Patches of dark , velvety skin called Acanthosis Nigricans
* Multiple small cysts in the ovaries.
* Depression and mood swings

#### What causes PCOS? 

The cause of PCOS is not exactly known but it is associated with raised
production of androgens (male hormones) in the body and hence the hirsutism and irregular
cycles. Insulin resistance is also an important feature of this disease; that is in pcos, the body
does not respond to the insulin produced in the body—leading to weight gain and a tendency to
develop Diabetes.
What are the Long Term Consequences of PCOS?
If unrecognised and untreated, PCOS increases the risk of Type2 Diabetes and Cardiovascular
Disease including Hypertension. Women with PCOS are at increased risk of developing GDM or
Diabetes associated with pregnancy. There is also an increased risk of developing sleep apnea
and daytime sleepiness.
Cancer and PCOS
Untreated PCOS and long periods of irregular cycles can lead to endometrial hyperplasia and an
increased risk of developing endometrial cancer.There does not appear to be any association
with breast or ovarian cancer.

#### Treatment/ Reduction of Long term risks

* Lifestyle changes including regular exercise and dietary changes is the first line of
treatment.
* Eat a balanced healthy diet including fruits, vegetables, whole grain cereals, lean meat
like chicken, fish and low fat milk products.
* Avoid excess fats like oil, butter and cheese.
* Eat regular meals. Do not skip breakfast.
* Exercise regularly ( 30 mins at least 3 times a week)
* Drug therapy may be required for specific problems like infertility and hirsutism. In severe
/ morbid obesity, anti obesity pills may be prescribed. Hormonal pills are often prescribed
to regularise the cycle.
* Have regular health check ups

#### Is there a cure?

There is no cure but maintaining a healthy lifestyle goes a long way towards reducing the
symptoms or preventing the long term consequences of PCOS.
September is PCOS awareness month organised in many parts of the world to raise awareness
about this most critical and under diagnosed disease affecting millions of women worldwide. The
worrying aspect of the epidemiology is that out of 10 women diagnosed in India, 6 are teenagers.
The cause for this is not exactly known but poor eating habits and lack of exercise are the likely
culprits. Hence raising awareness is the need of the hour for early diagnosis and treatment and
prevention of long term morbidity. There are several famous celebrities including Bollywood
actress Sonam Kapoor who have opened up in the recent past about their struggle with PCOS .
Their stories will hopefully raise awareness and encourage more young women
