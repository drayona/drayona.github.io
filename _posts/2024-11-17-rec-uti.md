Did you know that adult women are the group with highest risk of UTI or urinary tract infection, specially Acute Cystitis ( Bladder infection).1 in 5 adult women will experience UTI at least once in their lifetime. This is mainly because of the shorter length of the female urethra and also because of the changes in her body at different times of her life. Hence, pregnancy and menopause are both periods of high risk for UTI in a womanâ€™s life. Increased rates of UTI are also seen with sex ( so called honeymoon cystitis), because of proximity of the urethral opening to the vagina.
Common symptoms of acute cystitis are dysuria, frequency, urgency,feeling of bladder fullness, suprapubic pain and tenderness.

We will talk about prevention / decreasing the risk of recurrent cystitis in a later post
