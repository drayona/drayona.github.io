Awareness about preventive health, in general is low in Indian society. Amongst women, this  is even lower, maybe because of busy schedules, family obligations or lower education levels. Of course this cannot be generalised. Urban working women are more aware of the need for preventive health check ups.  They are tech savvy . They have more easy access to health care facilities and may have financial independence to focus on their needs.  And yet, we still see women, even educated urban women underestimating the health risk of a breast lump or abnormal menstrual bleeding.
Preventive health checks may vary depending on the age or particular medical history of the woman but in general, these are the areas of focus.
1.Breast cancer is the commonest cancer in Indian women. Breast is an organ that can be easily examined either manually or by ultrasound or Mammography. It is curable when treated properly and in time.
2.Cervical cancer  incidence rates vary but North East India still has very high rates of both incidence as well as deaths. It is estimated that 123,907 cases of invasive cervical cancer will occur every year in India with 77,348 deaths .This is a huge burden . Yet, this cancer can be prevented with a HPV vaccine and cured when diagnosed in the early stages. Regular screening with Pap smear or HPV testing is recommended for all sexually active women at 25-30 years of age.
3.Screening for chronic diseases like Diabetes and Hypertension should start at 50 or earlier if there are risk factors
4.Screening for anaemia is specially important for Indian women. 

 Awareness activities are very important to encourage such screenings and to prevent delay in seeking adequate and timely health care .
